# Intervals

Another common pattern is problems that involve intervals [start, end].
Usually, these problems can be solved by first sorting the input, then iterating over it while comparing adjacent intervals.

> [Example: 252. Meeting Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms/)
> Given an array of meeting times intervals where intervals[i] = [start, end] indicates the i'th meeting runs from [start, end), determine if one person could attend all meetings.
> For example, given intervals = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]], return false. If you attend the [0, 30] meeting, then you cannot attend the other two.
