Ahh, math problems. I like them the least! :D

## Factorization

Prime number only has two factors - one and the number itself.
Opposite of prime is composite.
We can get prime factors of number with the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/) algorithm which takes `O(n*log(log(n)))` to build.
Afterwards, `GetPrimeFactors` works in `O(logn)` time.
