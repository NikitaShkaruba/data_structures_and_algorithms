# Greedy

A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment.
The algorithm never reverses the earlier decision even if the choice is wrong.
It works in a top-down approach.

A counterpart to greedy is dynamic programming, where we check all the available options, not the single one.

If thereâ€™s only one answer and theres an optimal path you see - go for a greedy solution.
You should challenge your greedy approach with counter examples to understood that it works.
If it doesn't - try dynamic programming.
