# Backtracking

Backtracking is a recursive algorithm optimization that involves abandoning a "path" once it is determined that the path cannot lead to a solution.
The opposite of backtracking is exhaustive search.
Backtracking is different from DP, because backtracking decisions don't affect future decisions.
