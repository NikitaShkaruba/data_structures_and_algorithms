# Segment Tree

Is an abstraction similar to Prefix Sum. You create it for `O(n)` time and make range sum queries in `O(1)` time.
The new advantage is that you can also update elements in it in `O(logn)` time. 

Checkout `TestSegmentTree_Update` in [segment_tree_test.go](../../src/data_structures/segment_tree_test.go) for usage examples.
